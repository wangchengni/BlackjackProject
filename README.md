#BlackJackProject

##Description
I used a lot of if statement to loop all the conditions for the user to compare with the dealer.
The most tricky way is that user may have so many small numbers cards and they can ask a lot of hit
option, then, inside these hit option, I also need to consider whether they choose stand during these stand, or
whether they are bust, if they choose stand suddenly, then i need loop the dealer's card until dealer's value is 
greater than 17.

## Lessons learned
I feel more confident with the logical ,and the loops. However still really confused about the classes, extend, implements.
I feel hard to use these class methods to make my code dry, though this weekend is busy for me. But in the future two days,
I will try to rewrite this project to make all classes connected together, so that i can make the code more dry.
I think i still need more time on the extend, implements classes and more practice. So that I can apply them easily.
